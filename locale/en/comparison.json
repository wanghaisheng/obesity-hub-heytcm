  "comparison_challenge_title": "The Universal Weight Loss Dilemma: \"Clogged Drainage\"",
  "comparison_challenge_intro": "Imagine obesity as a \"clogged drain\" in a house. Body dysfunction is like poor drainage, leading to the accumulation of waste and dampness. Initially, the water might flow slowly, but it gradually progresses to complete blockage, causing issues like \"dampness and mold\" (e.g., fatigue, edema) and \"waste buildup\" (e.g., elevated blood lipids, fatty liver). Many common weight loss methods are like temporary unclogging measures, failing to fundamentally clean and repair the entire drainage system.",

  "comparison_tcm_title": "TCM Wisdom: Fundamentally \"Unclogging and Maintaining the Entire Drainage System\"",
  "comparison_tcm_analogy_desc": "Unlike temporary unclogging, TCM focuses on repairing and maintaining the entire \"house drainage system\" â€“ that is, regulating the body's internal balance and metabolic functions. TCM believes the root cause of obesity is \"blockage,\" specifically manifesting as \"dampness\" (water accumulation), \"phlegm\" (grease and sludge), \"stasis\" (hard lumps), and \"deficiency\" (aging pump, insufficient water pressure, loose pipes). Through pattern differentiation and treatment, TCM identifies the specific links and causes of \"blockage\" and then uses personalized natural herbal formulas, dietary and lifestyle adjustments, and even acupuncture and Tui Na, like a professional \"drainage maintenance technician,\" not only to clear existing blockages but also to restore the pipes' self-cleaning ability and the pump's normal power, achieving long-term patency.",

  "comparison_tcm_advantage1_title": "Personalized Diagnosis, Precise \"Unclogging\"",
  "comparison_tcm_advantage1_desc": "Like an experienced \"drainage technician,\" TCM differentiates patterns based on the individual's \"blockage\" type (e.g., \"dampness accumulation\" like stagnant water, \"phlegm coagulation\" like grease, \"blood stasis\" like hard objects, \"qi deficiency\" like a weak pump) and location, applying targeted \"unclogging solutions\" rather than a \"one-size-fits-all\" strong unclogger.",
  "comparison_tcm_advantage2_title": "Gentle Nourishment, Avoiding \"Pipe Damage\"",
  "comparison_tcm_advantage2_desc": "Mostly uses natural herbs, like using gentle enzymes to break down grease and soften hard lumps, rather than corrosive chemicals, thereby nourishing and repairing the \"pipe system\" while \"unclogging,\" avoiding side effects.",
  "comparison_tcm_advantage3_title": "Root Cause Management, Improving \"Water Quality\" and \"Water Flow\"",
  "comparison_tcm_advantage3_desc": "TCM not only focuses on \"unclogging\" but also emphasizes \"nourishing.\" By adjusting diet (not dumping \"grease\"), lifestyle habits (regularly \"flushing pipes\"), and emotional regulation (preventing \"stress from flattening pipes\"), from the source to reduce the production of \"blockages\", strengthen \"pump power\" (tonifying qi and blood), ensuring \"smooth water flow.\"",
  "comparison_tcm_advantage4_title": "Lasting Effects, Lowering \"Re-clogging\" Risk",
  "comparison_tcm_advantage4_desc": "By restoring the \"drainage system's\" self-cleaning and self-regulating ability, TCM achieves a fundamental improvement in constitution, resulting in more stable and lasting weight loss, like a thoroughly cleaned and maintained drain that is less likely to clog again.",
  "comparison_tcm_advantage5_title": "Holistic Conditioning, Enhancing Overall Health",
  "comparison_tcm_advantage5_desc": "While losing weight, TCM often improves sleep, energy, mood, and many other aspects, achieving an overall improvement in health, like how a clear drainage system improves the air and environment of the entire house.",
